# Documentation Generation Rule
When a new function or module is created, automatically generate comprehensive documentation including:
- Purpose of the function/module
- Parameters and their types
- Return values
- Example usage

## Continuous Documentation
Every time a new part of the app is created, documentation should be generated in the designated documentation folder. The following high-level pillars should be considered for future documentation:
- Integration with the PetFinder API
- Integration with OpenAI
- Turnstile implementation
- Styling changes

## Continuous Documentation Creation Guideline
When creating new parts of the app, follow these steps to ensure continuous documentation:
1. Identify the type of documentation needed (e.g. API integration, feature explanation, etc.)
2. Determine the target audience for the documentation
3. Create a clear and concise title for the documentation
4. Write a brief summary of the documentation content
5. Organize the content into logical sections and subsections
6. Use proper formatting and headings to make the documentation easy to read
7. Include relevant images, diagrams, or code snippets to support the documentation
8. Review and edit the documentation for clarity and accuracy
