# Development Status & Roadmap

## Current Status (February 2025)

### What Works
- Basic form submission with zip code validation
- Pet type selection (multi-select functionality)
- Results page display with pet cards
- AI recommendations with caching
- iOS-inspired gallery with smooth animations and lightbox view
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Error handling for most common scenarios

### Work in Progress
- **Zip Code Persistence**: Currently experiencing issues with zip code state management between routes
- **Loading States**: Need standardization across components
- **Geolocation Feature**: Requires improved reliability and error handling
- **Cache Management**: Implementing more sophisticated caching strategies

### Known Issues
1. **Zip Code Persistence Issue**
   - Results page sometimes shows "Please provide a zip code" even when zip code is present
   - Issue appears related to state management between client/server components
   - Current workaround: Manual refresh or re-entering zip code

2. **Geolocation Reliability**
   - Location detection occasionally returns invalid zip codes
   - OpenStreetMap data might not be accurate for all locations
   - Slow response times in some network conditions

3. **Loading State Inconsistency**
   - Multiple loading spinner implementations
   - Inconsistent appearance across components

## Recent Debugging Efforts
- Implemented expanded logging for zip code state tracking
- Tested alternative navigation methods between pages
- Added localStorage synchronization with URL parameters
- Analyzed client/server component hydration issues
- Tested in production environment to isolate development-specific issues

## Technical Debt
- Mixed state management approaches (URL params, localStorage, component state)
- Potential race conditions in state initialization
- Incomplete error boundary implementation
- Non-standardized loading indicators
- Duplicate code in some API integration points

## Roadmap

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. **Fix Zip Code Persistence**
   - Implement React Context for global state
   - Standardize URL parameter handling
   - Add proper error fallbacks

2. **Standardize Loading States**
   - Create unified loading component
   - Implement consistent styling
   - Add skeleton loaders for content

3. **Improve Geolocation**
   - Add better error handling
   - Implement retry logic
   - Consider alternative geocoding services

4. **Optimize API Usage**
   - Implement more robust caching
   - Add request batching where appropriate
   - Improve error recovery

### Medium-term Goals (1-3 Months)
1. **Enhanced Filtering**
   - Add more filter options (age, size, breed)
   - Implement filter persistence
   - Add filter analytics

2. **User Preferences**
   - Save preferred location
   - Remember pet type selections
   - Track viewed pets

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add animations for transitions
   - Improve accessibility
   - Enhance mobile interactions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement image lazy loading
   - Add caching headers
   - Reduce bundle size

### Long-term Goals (3+ Months)
1. **User Accounts**
   - Implement authentication
   - Save favorite pets
   - Track adoption progress

2. **Advanced AI Features**
   - Personalized recommendations based on history
   - Lifestyle matching
   - Pet compatibility analysis

3. **Shelter Integration**
   - Direct contact with shelters
   - Application submission
   - Adoption status tracking

4. **Analytics & Insights**
   - User behavior analysis
   - Recommendation effectiveness tracking
   - A/B testing framework

## Current Implementation Challenges

### Zip Code Implementation

#### Storage Mechanisms
- URL Parameters: `/results?zipCode=94063`
- localStorage: Key `searchZipCode`
- Component State: Managed in ResultsClient

#### Component Structure
- Server Component (`page.js`): Receives URL parameters
- Client Component (`results-client.js`): Handles state and API calls
- Search Form (`SearchForm.js`): Handles user input and navigation

#### Problem Areas
- Hydration mismatch between server and client rendering
- Race conditions in state initialization
- Navigation method inconsistencies
- Multiple sources of truth for zip code state

### AI Recommendation Implementation

#### Current Status
- Basic recommendation system implemented
- GPT-4o-mini model integration working
- Response parsing and display functional
- Caching implemented for performance

#### Challenges
- Token usage optimization
- Error handling refinement
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Prompt engineering improvements

### Gallery Implementation

#### Current Status
- iOS-inspired gallery component implemented
- Smooth animations with spring physics
- Swipeable navigation for mobile and desktop
- Responsive design with device-specific optimizations
- Lightbox view for enlarged images
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility features

#### Features
- Lazy loading for performance optimization
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Touch and mouse gesture support
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape)
- Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

#### Technical Implementation
- Built with React functional components and hooks
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- React Swipeable for gesture handling
- Next.js Image for optimized image loading
- Tailwind CSS for styling consistent with design system

## Testing Strategy
- Implement component unit tests
- Add integration tests for critical flows
- Perform cross-browser testing
- Conduct user testing sessions

## Documentation Needs
- Complete flow diagrams for state management
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Development environment setup instructions
- API documentation updates

## Deployment Updates
- Currently deployed on Vercel
- CI/CD pipeline implemented
- Environment variables configured
- Analytics integration pending
