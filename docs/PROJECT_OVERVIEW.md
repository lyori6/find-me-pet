# FindMePet Project Overview

FindMePet is a Next.js application built as a case study to demonstrate how to develop a pet discovery web app from scratch. While not intended for direct replication, it offers valuable insights for anyone looking for inspiration in building modern web experiences. This document serves as a detailed dive into the project's architecture, features, and underlying thought processes.

## Overview
FindMePet provides an interactive way to explore different pets, making it easy to learn about their characteristics and requirements. It was created as a learning project to showcase best practices when working with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Project Goals
- Deliver a clear example of a Next.js application that leverages server-side rendering and static generation.
- Demonstrate how to structure a project so that it remains flexible and maintainable as it grows.
- Offer real-world context on how to integrate external APIs or data sources to present dynamic content.

## Architecture
This project uses Next.js for both client- and server-side rendering. Below is an overview of the main directories and purpose of each:

```
findmepet/
├── pages/          # Core Next.js routes
├── components/     # Reusable React components
├── styles/         # Global and modular CSS files
├── lib/            # Shared helpers or utilities
├── public/         # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
├── next-env.d.ts   # TypeScript declarations
├── package.json
└── ...             # Additional configuration files
```

### Core Concepts
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and helps catch common errors early.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrates how to fetch pet data, potentially from a third-party API.
- **SSR & SSG**: Shows ways to handle data when rendering pages with Next.js.

## Features
- **Pet Catalog**: A listing of pets with images, short descriptions, and relevant details.
- **Search & Filtering**: Lets users quickly narrow down the catalog by various criteria.
- **Responsive UI**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Performance-focused**: Takes advantage of Next.js optimizations for a snappy user experience.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/findmepet.git
cd findmepet
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure Environment**
- Create a file named `.env.local` if you need any environment-specific variables or API keys.

4. **Run Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Access the main page at http://localhost:3000. You can then browse through the pet listings. If configured, the application may allow searching or filtering to help you find pets that match specific criteria like size or breed.

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **Structure Matters**: Grouping components, pages, and utilities in logical directories keeps the codebase organized.
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript can significantly reduce errors by ensuring consistent data shapes.
3. **API Integration**: Setting up a clear strategy for data fetching (SSR, SSG, or client-side) plays an important role in performance and user experience.

## Potential Future Improvements
- **Authentication**: Let users save pets or make adoption inquiries.
- **Location-based Filtering**: Integrate geolocation services to suggest nearby adoptable pets.
- **Testing Suite**: Add unit tests with Jest or React Testing Library to improve reliability.
