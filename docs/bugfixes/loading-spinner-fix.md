# Loading Spinner Fix

## Issue Description

The loading spinner was not appearing in the UI despite the loading text being displayed. The spinner was properly implemented in the code but was not visible in the rendered DOM.

## Root Causes

1. **Tailwind CSS Animation Purging**: The `animate-spin` class might have been purged during the build process.
2. **CSS Animation Conflicts**: Potential conflicts with other CSS animations or styles.
3. **Component Rendering Issues**: The spinner component might not have been properly integrated with the rest of the UI.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Self-Contained LoadingSpinner Component

We completely revised the LoadingSpinner component to be self-contained and not rely on external CSS classes. Key improvements:

- Used inline styles for all styling properties instead of Tailwind classes
- Embedded the keyframes animation directly in the component using CSS-in-JSX
- Simplified the component structure for better reliability
- Made the component more flexible with size and text position options

```jsx
// Spinning inner ring with inline styles for the animation
<div 
  className="spinner-element"
  style={{
    width: `${spinnerSize.outer}px`,
    height: `${spinnerSize.outer}px`,
    borderRadius: '50%',
    borderWidth: `${spinnerSize.border}px`,
    borderStyle: 'solid',
    borderTopColor: primaryColor,
    borderRightColor: secondaryColor,
    borderBottomColor: secondaryColor,
    borderLeftColor: primaryColor,
    animation: 'spin 1s linear infinite',
    display: 'block',
  }}
></div>

{/* Add keyframes for the animation directly in the component */}
<style jsx>{`
  @keyframes spin {
    0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
    100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
  }
  .spinner-element {
    animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
  }
`}</style>
```

### 2. Simplified PetDetailsClient.js Implementation

We simplified the spinner implementation in PetDetailsClient.js:

- Removed any dependencies on external animation libraries
- Used a clean, simple implementation that focuses on just showing the spinner
- Ensured proper visibility with inline styles

```jsx
{/* Single spinner implementation */}
<div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>
  <LoadingSpinner 
    size="large" 
    text={pet?.name ? `Getting information about ${pet.name}...` : "Loading pet details..."}
    textPosition="bottom"
  />
</div>
```

### 3. Added Spinner Test Page

We created a dedicated test page at `/spinner-test` to:

- Verify spinner functionality in isolation
- Test different spinner variations (sizes and text positions)
- Provide controls to toggle loading state for testing

### 4. Cleaned Up Global CSS

We removed redundant animation definitions from the global CSS file since:

- The spinner now defines its own animation internally
- This prevents conflicts with other CSS rules
- It makes the component more portable and self-contained

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Visit the `/spinner-test` page to see all spinner variations
2. Test different sizes and text positions to ensure all variations work
3. Verify the spinner appears during loading states on the Pet Details page

## Future Considerations

- Consider using a more robust CSS-in-JS solution for critical UI components
- Add visual regression tests to catch UI issues early
- Document the component in a component library for team reference
