## Implementation Details

### Gallery Component
The image gallery is implemented in the `PetDetailsClient.js` component with the following key elements:

1. **State Management**:
   - `activePhotoIndex`: Tracks the currently displayed image
   - `enlargedImage`: Stores the URL of the enlarged image (if any)
   - `touchStart/touchEnd`: Manages touch events for swipe gestures

2. **Navigation Functions**:
   - `nextPhoto()`: Advances to the next image/video
   - `prevPhoto()`: Returns to the previous image/video
   - `handleImageClick()`: Opens the enlarged view

3. **Touch Handling**:
   - `handleTouchStart()`: Records initial touch position
   - `handleTouchMove()`: Tracks finger movement
   - `handleTouchEnd()`: Calculates swipe direction and distance

### Enlarged View Modal
The enlarged view is implemented as a modal overlay with the following features:

1. **Modal Controls**:
   - Close button positioned at the top-right corner
   - Background tap to close
   - Helper text for mobile users
